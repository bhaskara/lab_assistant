This is a command-line tool that facilitates running computational experiments with varying parameters and collecting and organizing the results.  

The main requirement is that your experiment is a program runnable from the command line, and the parameters can be set using command line arguments.  lab_assistant will take care of running on all parameter combinations you specify, collecting the results of stdout and stderr (and any other output files you specify) and putting them in an organized directory structure.
